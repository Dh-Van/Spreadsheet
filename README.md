# Spreadsheet
Creating my own spreadsheet editor (like excel and google sheets) to advance my coding skills

## Project Requirements
- [ ] Written in C++
  - I have always been interested in learning C++, and it seems like this language is here to stay
- [ ] Use good programming practicies (including documentation)
    - This is paramount because I am trying to get better at coding
- [ ] Want it to look modern
    - It should be nice to look at
- [ ] Set my own keybinds
    - Some keybinds in Sheets and Excel really annoy me
- [ ] Hopefully finish before the end of summer vacation (09/01/2024)
    - Having an end product to show for my efforts would be nice

## Goals
- [ ] Create a GUI application resembling google sheets
- [ ] Functionality for Keyboard and Mouse actions
- [ ] Backend language for basic operations (SUM, SUBTRACT, MULTIPLY, DIVIDE)
- [ ] Export in a .csv file
- [ ] Column and Row addition
